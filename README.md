FLORAL AI is a machine learning project designed to recognize and classify images of flowers. Using a trained model, the application identifies and categorizes flowers into one of five classes: Daisy, Dandelion, Tulip, Rose, and Sunflower. The front end is built using Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use web interface where users can upload flower images and receive predictions in real-time.

FEATURES:
1. Image Classification: Upload an image of a flower, and the model will classify it into one of the five flower types.
2. Streamlit Frontend: A simple, intuitive interface allowing users to drag and drop images or browse files for upload.
3. Model Accuracy: The machine learning model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for high accuracy in image classification.
4. Fast Predictions: Get real-time classification results after uploading an image.

CLASSES:
1. Daisy
2. Dandelion
3. Rose
4. Tulip
5. Sunflower
